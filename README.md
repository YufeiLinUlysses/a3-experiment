### Assignment 3 - Replicating a Classic Experiment

The purpose of our experiment is to investigate the effect of different visualization charts on people's perceived ability to estimate the average value of the given data. To make the experimental task more concrete and easy to understand, we use the specific data of Netflix's subscription costs in different regions, given the maximum and minimum values, and ask users to guess the average costs in the regions listed in the chart.

Here's our experiment/survey link: https://jasminezzz9.github.io/survey/

We use 7 different kinds of visualizations:
- Bar chart
- Horizontal bar chart
- Pie charts
- Circular bar chart
- Lollipop charts
- Wordcloud
- Choropleth map

And based on the visualizations we used, we have several hypotheses:
- In the task of guessing the average values, does the direction of the bar chart have an effect on the user's perceptions? (bar chart & horizontal bar chart)
- Would a pie chart be more accurate than a circular bar chart for the task of guessing the average values?
- Would a lollipop chart perform better than a bar chart in the task of guessing the average values?
- In the task of guessing averages, would the more graphical presentations, like choropleth map and wordcloud, provide better information to the users than the regular charts?
